# Proposal 00002: Sub-Certifying Authority for DGCA

Certifying Authorities, such as e-Mudhra, must create a Sub-Certifying Authority for DGCA which would be the default Certifying Authority for all RPAS, RPAS Manufacturer and Digital Sky Service Provider certificates. This would be in parallel to existing Sub-CA for DGFT.
